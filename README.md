# voronoiTrack
Procedural 2D track generation using randomly generated Voronoi diagram.

The tracks generated using the `generate.py` script can be stored as 2 dimensional point array (in numpy format) by specifying `-b QTY`/`--batch QTY` (with QTY as the number of tracks to generate).
Saved tracks can be later visualized using the `visualize.py` script.

This project is still in early developement, many solutions are temporary and many options are not available.
